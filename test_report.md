# Grassroots Match Tracker - Test Report

## Backend API Tests

The backend API tests were successful. The following endpoints were tested:

- GET / - Returns the API information
- GET /api/teams - Returns a list of teams (found 6 teams)
- GET /api/formations - Returns a list of formations (found 5 formations: 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, 4-2-3-1, 5-3-2)
- GET /api/teams/{team_id}/players - Returns a list of players for a team (found 6 players for a team)
- POST /api/teams - Creates a new team
- POST /api/players - Creates a new player
- POST /api/matches - Creates a new match
- GET /api/matches - Returns a list of matches (found 3 matches)

All API endpoints are working as expected.

## Frontend Tests

The frontend tests were partially successful. We were able to verify that:

- The React app is being served correctly on port 3000
- The HTML structure is correct with the React mount point and bundle script

However, we encountered issues with the browser automation tool, which consistently navigated to the backend API instead of the frontend. This suggests there might be a routing or proxy issue in the test environment.

## Integration Tests

Due to the issues with the browser automation tool, we were unable to fully test the integration between the frontend and backend. However, based on the code review:

- The frontend is configured to use the backend API via the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable
- API calls in the frontend code are properly structured to communicate with the backend
- The backend API endpoints match what the frontend is expecting

## Issues Found

1. **Frontend Code Issue**: There was a duplicate declaration of the `fetchPlayers` function in App.js, which was causing the frontend to fail to compile. This was fixed by removing the duplicate function.

2. **Testing Environment Issue**: The browser automation tool consistently navigated to the backend API instead of the frontend, making it difficult to test the UI and integration.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Frontend Routing**: Ensure that the frontend is properly configured to handle routing and that there are no proxy issues that might redirect requests to the backend.

2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add better error handling in the frontend for API calls to provide better feedback to users when there are issues.

3. **Add More Tests**: Once the routing issues are resolved, add more comprehensive tests for the UI and integration between frontend and backend.

4. **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix any other potential issues like the duplicate function declaration.

## Conclusion

The Grassroots Match Tracker application has a solid foundation with a working backend API and a frontend that is structured correctly. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed before it can be considered fully functional.
